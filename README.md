Unlock the secrets of encryption with my Python script! Now you can effortlessly encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Your data stays safe with this powerful tool.

# About Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a classical encryption method attributed to Julius Caesar, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This technique provides a basic yet effective means of encrypting messages, making it a foundational concept in cryptography and an excellent starting point for understanding more complex encryption algorithms.
